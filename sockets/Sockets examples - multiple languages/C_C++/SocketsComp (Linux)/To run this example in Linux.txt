Options: 

1. Client and server on same machine: Open two instances of the terminal (in Ubuntu)
2. Client and server on seprate machines: Open server and client separately (need IP address of server) - Use another computer on the same network with this program or run 2 VMs (make sure to run a 'Bridged' (for Ethernet) or 'NAT' for wireless network connection

To run the programs

2. Navigate to folder with s.c (server) and c.c (client)
3. Compile both s.c and c.c  
      gcc -o server s.c
      gcc -o client c.c

Note: If you don't have gcc installed on your machine then run:

$ sudo apt-get install gcc

From the terminal

4. Run the server via command: ./server
5. Run the client via command: ./client 127.0.0.1    <-- This means 'localhost' / Otherwise
				
					or

				./client IP address of server (use ifconfig to find address of server)
				
If you have a problem establishing a socket in Linux using these programs, add permissions on the files/folders

$ chmod 777 -R '<folder name>'
